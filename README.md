🌌 Overall Look & Feel

Typography: Keep it clean and modern — e.g., sans-serif like Gotham (which you already use for Lyonite), or Space Grotesk for a subtle cosmic touch. Pair with a thinner font for body text.

Colors: A dark background (#0b0f19 or #171823) with gradients like deep navy → violet. Accent with neon blues (#86e3f2), soft whites (#ededed), and a hint of starlight gold (#f6c56e) for highlights.

Imagery: Instead of literal rockets/astronauts, use abstract nebula gradients, particle effects, and subtle starfield animations.

Micro-details: Animated shooting stars on hover, constellation-like connecting lines between sections, and orbital motion for icons.

🪐 Sections & Content
1. Hero Section (Landing Page)

Professional but cosmic headline + subtext:

Headline: “Exploring the Frontiers of AI, One Project at a Time.”

Subheadline: “I’m Jihad Ftouny — AI Instructor, Entrepreneur, and Builder. I merge creativity, technology, and design to craft solutions that feel like they’re from the future.”

CTA:

Primary: “View My Work” (scrolls to projects/case studies).

Secondary: “Read My Blog” (links to blog).

Visual: A subtle rotating 3D planet/globe with orbiting icons representing skills (AI, teaching, e-commerce, design).

2. About Me (Mission Control)

Frame it like a commander’s log.

Brief bio: background (AI instructor, founder of Lyonite, consultant).

Mission statement: “I build at the intersection of artificial intelligence, business, and design.”

Add a professional portrait (lit with space-themed shadows/gradient glow).

Fun touch: timeline shown as a space journey trajectory (points = major milestones like teaching at AUB, launching Lyonite, leading workshops).

3. Case Studies / Projects (Launch Pad)

Rename projects section → “Missions” or “Launch Pad.”

For each project, have a mission patch-style thumbnail (like NASA badges).

Layout: grid with hover animations that reveal title + “Explore Mission.”

Each case study page could have sections like: Mission Objective, Process, Results, Lessons Learned.

4. Blog (Observatory)

Rename blog → “Observatory.”

Angle: “Insights and Reflections from the AI Cosmos.”

Keep posts simple, but add cover images with space-gradient overlays to unify the look.

5. Skills & Tools (Constellation Map)

Even though you didn’t list it yet, a dedicated skills section will make it feel more professional.

Visual: constellation-style map where each star is a skill (Python, ML/DL, Teaching, Copywriting, Shopify dev, etc.).

Text: Short blurbs under categories like Artificial Intelligence, Education, Business, Design.

6. Testimonials / Collaborations (Allies in Orbit)

If you can gather testimonials from Zaka, AUB, students, or collaborators → include them.

Visual: faces/logos inside orbit rings around your profile photo/planet.

7. Contact (Docking Station)

You already have this. Keep it professional:

Clean form, clear social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).

Add a playful but professional tagline: “Ready to launch something together? Let’s connect.”

🚀 Small but Impactful Touches

Loading screen: a quick animation of a rocket launching or a rotating ring before page loads.

Cursor trail: faint stardust effect when hovering over links.

404 Page: “Lost in Space? Let’s get you back on course.” with a link home.
